        <!-- Live Coordination -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Live Coordination</h2>
            <p>
                GameForge Token is currently operating a live, off-chain coordination system
                to validate demand and execution before any on-chain deployment.
            </p>
            <p>Active coordination includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public Build Requests submitted via GitHub Issues</li>
                <li>A transparent Participation Ledger recording accepted contributions</li>
                <li>Human-reviewed contribution evaluation via a Core Review Group (CRG)</li>
                <li>Real-time activity visibility through public repositories</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This coordination layer is intentionally operated without a live token,
                liquidity pools, or automated incentives.
            </p>
            <p>
                On-chain components will only be introduced if coordination demand justifies them.
            </p>

        <!-- Stop Conditions -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Stop Conditions</h2>
            <p>
                GameForge Token is an experiment in coordination, not a guaranteed product.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project will not proceed to token deployment if:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no clear evidence that on-chain coordination improves outcomes compared to off-chain tools</li>
                <li>Contributor behaviour cannot be evaluated fairly without extractive or speculative incentives</li>
                <li>Coordination demand does not exceed what can be handled through off-chain processes</li>
                <li>A token would primarily benefit speculative participants rather than active builders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If these conditions are not satisfied, GameForge Token will remain a research initiative
                and will not deploy a live token.

        <!-- Why I'm Building This -->
        <section class="section founder-statement">
            <h2>Why I'm Building GameForge</h2>
            <p>
                I'm not building GameForge because I believe every project needs a token.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm building it because I don't believe most crypto projects are honest about
                coordination, incentives, or when a token is actually justified.
            </p>
            <p>
                GameForge is an attempt to test that properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're running coordination in public, without a live token, to understand
                what builders actually need, where incentives help or harm, and whether
                on-chain mechanisms add real value or just complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this experiment shows that a token improves outcomes, we'll proceed carefully.
                If it doesn't, we won't deploy one.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the point.
            </p>
